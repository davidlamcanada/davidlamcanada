Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! :adult:

My name is David. I am a recent data analytics student :man_student::canada:. I am currently developing my skills in Python, SQL, R, Hadoop, PowerBI, and Tableau.<br/>

In my spare time, I like to read :books:, exercise :running:, and play video games :computer:.

I am looking forward to collaborating with Github members on intriguing datasets. 

You can connected with me on [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/davidlamcanada).
