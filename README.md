Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! 


My name is David. I am a recent data analytics student. I am currently developing my skills in Python, SQL, R, Hadoop, PowerBI, Tableau. Looking forward to collaborating with Githubs members on exciting and intriguing datasets.

In my spare time, I like to read, exercise, and play video games.
