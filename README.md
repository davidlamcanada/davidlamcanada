### Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! [:adult:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet) 

My name is David. I am a recent data analytics student [:canada:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet) [:man_student:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet). I am currently using The Odin Project and Scrimba to boost my web development knowledge.
 
In my spare time, I like to read [:books:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet), exercise [:running:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet), and play video games [:computer:](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet).
